# Dog-Breed-Classification
Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN) to detect and classify dogs in images

# Project Overview
This is my second project i did in the Deep learning Nanodegree of Udacity using Convolutional Neural Network. In this project, I have learned how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

# Problem
Statement: Having dataset of human faces and dataset for dog images, the Network is trained to detect the human and dogs in images and gives percentage of the accuracy of the trained model in terms of how many images in the human dataset are detected to be human face and how many images in dog dataset are detected to have dogs.

Using CNN and the trained model, another job is done which is classifying the dog's breed in each image and if a human is detected, the resembling breed shall be classified.
